## Hashing

***Hashing in blockchain is a cryptographic process which takes an input (such as text) and turns it into an output of fixed length and structure known as the 'hash value'. It is always the same length and one-way, meaning it cannot be reversed.***

**use cases:-**
    
   ****Hashing is primarily used for security purposes, and specifically those in cybersecurity. Ahashed 
     value has many uses, but it’s primarily meant to encode a plaintext value so the enclosed 
    information can’t be exposed. The hashing process is non-reversible or extremely difficult to 
    decode, making it often used as a cryptography technique****

# Key Takeaways

- ***Hashing in blockchain is a cryptographic process used to generate digital fingerprints for secure transaction verification and password storage.***


- ***Hash functions are essential components of the Proof of Work consensus algorithm, providing security and stability to blockchain networks.***


- ***Bitcoin’s energy intensive mining has raised concerns about its environmental impact while Ethereum’s move to a Proof of Stake consensus leads to reduced energy consumption with lower carbon footprint.***



***Understanding Hashing in Blockchain
Hashing in blockchain implies the transformation of input data into a fixed size output through a specific algorithm. It establishes data integrity***

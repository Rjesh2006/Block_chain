## Hashing

***Hashing in blockchain is a cryptographic process which takes an input (such as text) and turns it into an output of fixed length and structure known as the 'hash value'. It is always the same length and one-way, meaning it cannot be reversed.***

  - **use cases**
    
   ***Hashing is primarily used for security purposes, and specifically those in cybersecurity. Ahashed 
     value has many uses, but it’s primarily meant to encode a plaintext value so the enclosed 
    information can’t be exposed. The hashing process is non-reversible or extremely difficult to 
    decode, making it often used as a cryptography technique***

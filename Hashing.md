## Hashing

***Hashing is the practice of transforming a given key or string of characters into another value for the purpose of security. Unlike standard encryption, hashing is always used for one-way encryption, and hashed values are very difficult to decode.***

  - **use cases**
    
   ***Hashing is primarily used for security purposes, and specifically those in cybersecurity. Ahashed 
     value has many uses, but it’s primarily meant to encode a plaintext value so the enclosed 
    information can’t be exposed. The hashing process is non-reversible or extremely difficult to 
    decode, making it often used as a cryptography technique***

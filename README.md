# Blockchain Definition:
- **Ledger:** A constantly growing file recording all transactions.
- **Permanent:** Transactions are permanently recorded once added to the blockchain.
- **Secure:** Advanced cryptography ensures data remains locked within the blockchain.
- **Chronological:** Transactions occur in sequence, building upon each other.
- **Immutable:** Ledger entries cannot be changed once added.

# Use Cases:
- **Cryptocurrencies:** Primary use as a distributed ledger for digital currencies.
- **Business Applications:** Promising in various sectors like banking, finance, healthcare, etc.

# Key Features:
- **Immutability:** Ledger entries are permanent and unalterable.
- **Distributed:** All participants have a copy of the ledger for transparency.
- **Decentralized:** No central authority controls the network.
- **Security:** Data integrity ensured through advanced cryptography.
- **Consensus:** Agreement among participants on valid transactions.
- **Faster Settlement:** Accelerated trade settlement due to agreed-upon data.

# Consensus Mechanisms:
- **Proof of Work (PoW):** Miners solve puzzles to validate transactions.
- **Proof of Stake (PoS):** Validators chosen based on cryptocurrency holdings.
- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS):** Limited delegates validate transactions.
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT):** Focus on consensus despite faulty nodes.

# Smart Contracts:
- **Definition:** Self-executing contracts with predefined rules.
- **Execution:** Automatically execute when conditions are met.
- **Platforms:** Built on blockchain platforms like Ethereum enabling DApps.

# Public vs. Private Blockchains:
- **Public:** Open, transparent, and decentralized (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
- **Private:** Restricted access, controlled by a single entity (e.g., for enterprise use).

# Blockchain Challenges:
- **Scalability:** Efficiently handling large transaction volumes.
- **Interoperability:** Ensuring communication between different blockchains.
- **Security:** Protecting against attacks and vulnerabilities.

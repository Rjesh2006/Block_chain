### Cryptography, Networking, and Blockchain Concepts



1. **Elliptic Curve**: A type of mathematical curve used in cryptography for generating cryptographic keys and protocols.

2. **Violet Adrus**: This term doesn't seem to correspond to a known concept in cryptography or networking. It might be a misspelling or a specific term from a particular context.

3. **Public Key**: A cryptographic key that can be freely distributed and is used for encryption or verification.

4. **Base-64**: A method of encoding binary data into ASCII characters to ensure it can be safely transmitted over text-based protocols.

5. **SHA-256**: A cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value.

6. **CSR (Certificate Signing Request)**: A request sent to a Certificate Authority (CA) to apply for a digital certificate.

7. **Root CA (Certificate Authority)**: The top-level entity in a public key infrastructure (PKI) hierarchy that issues digital certificates.

8. **Wireshark**: A network protocol analyzer used for troubleshooting, analysis, and development of communication protocols.

9. **EC-DSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)**: A digital signature algorithm based on elliptic curve cryptography.

10. **Session Key**: A temporary encryption key used for securing communications during a single session or transaction.

11. **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: A symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing sensitive data.

12. **QRNG (Quantum Random Number Generator)**: A device or algorithm that generates random numbers based on the principles of quantum mechanics.

13. **Seed Private Key**: A cryptographic key used as the initial input for generating other keys in a deterministic manner.

14. **Random Device (for Generating Private Key)**: A physical or virtual device used to generate random numbers for cryptographic purposes.

15. **BIP-32 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 32)**: A standard for hierarchical deterministic wallets used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

16. **Cipher Suites**: Sets of cryptographic algorithms used for securing network communications.

17. **P-256**: A widely used elliptic curve defined over a prime field with a 256-bit prime modulus.

18. **Double Ratchet Encryption**: A cryptographic protocol used for securing end-to-end encrypted messaging applications.

19. **Matrix Polygon EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal)**: A proposal for enhancing the Ethereum blockchain network.

20. **Sharding**: A scalability technique used in blockchain networks to partition data into smaller subsets called shards.

21. **TPS (Transactions Per Second)**: A measure of the number of transactions processed by a system within one second.

22. **Ethereum, Solana, Polygon**: These are all blockchain platforms with their own unique features and ecosystems.

### Cryptography, Networking, and Blockchain Concepts



1. **Elliptic Curve**:
   - An elliptic curve is a mathematical curve used in cryptography for generating cryptographic keys and protocols.
   - It has properties that make it suitable for encryption, digital signatures, and other cryptographic operations.

2. **Violet Adrus**:
  

3. **Public Key**:
   - A public key is part of asymmetric cryptography.
   - It can be freely distributed and is used for encryption or verification.

4. **Base-64**:
   - Base-64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme.
   - It represents binary data (such as cryptographic keys or images) using a set of 64 different printable characters.
   - Commonly used for encoding data in a format that can be safely transmitted over text-based protocols.

5. **SHA-256**:
   - SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function.
   - It produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value.
   - Widely used for data integrity verification and password hashing.

6. **CSR (Certificate Signing Request)**:
   - A CSR is a request sent to a Certificate Authority (CA) to apply for a digital certificate.
   - Contains information about the entity requesting the certificate and the associated public key.

7. **Root CA (Certificate Authority)**:
   - The top-level entity in a public key infrastructure (PKI) hierarchy.
   - Issues digital certificates to subordinate CAs and end entities.
   - Trust in the PKI relies on the security of the root CA.

8. **Wireshark**:
   - Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer used for troubleshooting, analysis, and development of communication protocols.
   - Captures and inspects network traffic to diagnose issues and understand network behavior.

9. **EC-DSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)**:
   - EC-DSA is a digital signature algorithm based on elliptic curve cryptography.
   - Allows users to sign messages and verify signatures using elliptic curve keys.

10. **Session Key**:
    - A temporary encryption key used for securing communications during a single session or transaction.
    - Generated dynamically and discarded after the session ends.

11. **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**:
    - AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing sensitive data.
    - Operates on fixed-size blocks of data and supports key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

12. **QRNG (Quantum Random Number Generator)**:
    - A device or algorithm that generates random numbers based on quantum mechanics principles.
    - Provides true randomness compared to classical random number generators.

13. **Seed Private Key**:
    - Used as the initial input for generating other keys in a deterministic manner.
    - Often used in hierarchical deterministic wallets (e.g., BIP-32 wallets).

14. **Random Device (for Generating Private Key)**:
    - A physical or virtual device used to generate random numbers for cryptographic purposes.
    - High-quality randomness is essential for secure key generation.

15. **BIP-32 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 32)**:
    - Defines a standard for hierarchical deterministic wallets used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
    - Allows users to derive multiple child keys from a single seed key.

16. **Cipher Suites**:
    - Sets of cryptographic algorithms used for securing network connections.
    - Define encryption, authentication, and key exchange methods during communication.

17. **P-256 (Elliptic Curve)**:
    - Refers to an elliptic curve defined over a prime field with a 256-bit prime modulus.
    - Widely used in cryptography for secure operations.

18. **Double Ratchet Encryption**:
    - Provides end-to-end encryption for instant messaging applications.
    - Combines cryptographic ratchets for forward secrecy and automatic reestablishment of secrecy.

19. **Matrix Polygon EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal)**:
    - Not widely recognized; might be related to enhancing the Ethereum network.

20. **Sharding**:
    - Technique to enhance blockchain scalability by partitioning data into smaller shards.
    - Each shard contains its own data, improving network latency.

21. **TPS (Transactions Per Second)**:
    - Measures the maximum number of transactions processed per second.
    - Critical for comparing blockchain speeds.

22. **Ethereum, Solana, Polygon**:
    - Blockchain platforms with unique features and ecosystems.
    - Ethereum: Smart contract platform.
    - Solana: High throughput and low fees.
    - Polygon (formerly Matic): Improves Ethereum scalability through layer-2 solutions.
